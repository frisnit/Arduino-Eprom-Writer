# Arduino-Eprom-Writer
An EPROM reader/writer for Arduino

These two sketches read/write type 2532 4k and 2516 2k UV-erasable EPROMs. It was developed to troubleshoot/replace ROMs in an old arcade machine.

## Reading data
Data output as hex dump or Intel Hex file format

Insert EPROM into the socket and power up the Arduino

Upload the `eprom-reader.ino` sketch. Once the device is initialised, LED 1 will flash.

Then open the serial monitor and the EPROM contents will be read out and dumped over the serial monitor

Comment/uncomment dumpRomText() and dumpRomIntelHex() to select desired output format

Comment/uncomment the appropriate 'for' loop to read 4k or 2k ROMs

## Writing data
Data to write is placed in a static array in `image.h`. Use the C utility `bin2c` to convert binary files to a 'C' array compatible with this sketch.

Set the VPP switch to 5V before powering up

Upload the `eprom-writer.ino` sketch. Once LED1 and LED2 are flashing alternately open the serial monitor and follow the instructions to start programming.

When finished, switch VPP back to 5V and disconnect the Arduino.

## Implementation
I used an Olimexino-32U4 which is equivalent to an Arduino Leonardo. I had an old 28 pin ZIF socket so just used the top 24 pins for the 2532 and 2516 parts. The programming voltage is generated by a boost converter module from eBay adjusted to 25V.

## Circuit diagram
This is my circuit, but you can wire it up how you like as long as you update the pin definitions in the sketches:

And here's what it looks like, built on a prototyping shield:
